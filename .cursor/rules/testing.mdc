You can test edits you make to scripts by running the compiled script in /user/build/fcp-git-user.sh.  Before running the that script, you must compile them using //user/compile.sh --no-build (the --no-build flag only compiles the script and doesn't build the Platypus app.)  You can then run the script in /user/build/fcp-git-user.sh.  
Add the --debug flag to write all logs to the console instead of the log file. You can add the -navbar or -progress flags to simulate the different platypus apps.
Important: compile.sh only concatenates the other scripts together, and will not fail to build if there are syntax errors, so you can not use it to test your syntax.
